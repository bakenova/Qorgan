# Qorgan
An app for the SheCodes2022
Working in a team of three people, we decided to create the “Qorgan” application, the essence of which was voice recognition. 
In case of danger, depending on the word spoken by the user, a call would have been made to 112 or a message sent with locations to selected users. 
Following frameworks were used to create MVP: CoreLocation, MessageUI, InstantSearchVoiceOverlay
